## Workflow for writeups
<ol>
  <li><b>Fork Repository: </b>To fork the <i>ctfs</i> repository, click on the <b>Fork</b> button on the top rightmost side of the repository.</li>
  <li><b>Clone the forked repository: </b>Clone the repository to your local computer. You can use command <code>git clone link_of_forked_repository</code></li>
  <li><b>Add remote (original repo): </b>Add Gajabaar/ctfs as remote repository. Use command <code>git remote add remote_name link_of_Gajabaar_repo</code></li>
  <li><b>Fetch changes from original repo: </b>Fetch changes from Gajabaar/ctfs. Use command <code>git fetch remote_name</code></li>
  <li><b>Create a topic branch: </b>To add your changes create a topic branch. You can use <code>git checkout -b branch_name</code> to checkout to the topic branch</li>
  <li><b>Add your changes locally to the topic branch: </b>Make changes that you like locally. Stage and commit your changes.</li>
  <li><b>Push your branch changes on your forked repository: </b>After you have committed your changes, push them to your forked repository. Use command <code>git push origin branch_name</code></li>
  <li><b>Create Pull Request from the branch: </b>Go to your forked repository. Under your topic branch_name notice a button <b>Pull Request</b>. Click the button to make a pull request. Give a descriptive title and description.</li>
  <li><b>After your request gets accepted: </b></li>
  <ol>
    <li>Delete topic branch locally and in github. To delete the branch locally, use command <code>git branch -d branch_name</code>. To delete the branch on your remote forked repository, use command <code>git push origin --delete branch_name</code></li>
    <li>Sync forked repository and local repository. To sync with Gajabaar/ctfs, fetch the changes from remote_name. Merge those changes locally and push them to your forked repository.</li>
